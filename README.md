# Bookstore POS System

This project was written in Java for a coding class. The project is run through BookstoreTestHarness.java. 
The project simulates a POS system for a bookstore by keeping track of all purchases for the day and makes
accounts for all customers. When starting the program there is a main menu that gives you the option to
restock, add, or remove from inventory, register a new member, make a purchase, check inventory, or exit 
the program. This is done by inputing the indexes 1-5.
